# Self-Adaptive Testing in the Field
## Authors: Samira Silva, Patrizio Pelliccione, Antonia Bertolino

### Abstract: 
We are increasingly surrounded by systems connecting us with the digital world and facilitating our life
by supporting our work, leisure, activities at home, health, etc. These systems are pressed by two forces.
On the one side, they operate in environments that are increasingly challenging due to uncertainty and
uncontrollability. On the other side, they need to evolve, often in a continuous fashion, to meet changing
needs, to offer new functionalities, or also to fix emerging failures. To make the picture even more complex,
these systems rarely work in isolation and often need to collaborate with other systems, as well as humans.
All such facets call for moving their validation during operation, as offered by approaches called testing in the
field.
In this paper, we observe that even the field-based testing approaches should change over time to follow and
adapt to the changes and evolution of collaborating systems or environments or usersâ€™ behaviors. We provide
a taxonomy of this new category of testing that we call self-adaptive testing in the field (SATF), together
with a reference architecture for SATF approaches. To achieve this objective, we surveyed the literature and
collected feedback and contributions from experts in the domain via a questionnaire and interviews.
