# Self-Adaptive Testing in the Field
## Authors: Samira Silva, Patrizio Pelliccione, Antonia Bertolino

### Abstract: 
We are increasingly surrounded by systems connecting us with the digital world and facilitating our life
by supporting our work, leisure, activities at home, health, etc. These systems are pressed by two forces.
On the one side, they operate in environments that are increasingly challenging due to uncertainty and
uncontrollability. On the other side, they need to evolve, often in a continuous fashion, to meet changing
needs, to offer new functionalities, or also to fix emerging failures. To make the picture even more complex,
these systems rarely work in isolation and often need to collaborate with other systems, as well as humans.
All such facets call for moving their validation during operation, as offered by approaches called testing in the
field.
In this paper, we observe that even the field-based testing approaches should change over time to follow and
adapt to the changes and evolution of collaborating systems or environments or usersâ€™ behaviors. We provide
a taxonomy of this new category of testing that we call self-adaptive testing in the field (SATF), together
with a reference architecture for SATF approaches. To achieve this objective, we surveyed the literature and
collected feedback and contributions from experts in the domain via a questionnaire and interviews.

### Replication Package:
1. **Initial List of Papers:** It contains the initial list of papers gathered by using our search string in three databases: Scopus, ACM DL and IEEExplore.
2. **List of Papers after Relevance Evaluation:** We screened the papers by simply reading their title and abstract as there were a variety of papers that matched the query but were not pertinent. Then, this is the list of possible relevant papers after removing duplicates.  
3. **Final List (Regular process):** This is the final list of papers after applying the selection criteria during the regular process. 
4. **Snowballing - Phase 1 - All:** List of papers retrieved when performing the first iteration of snowballing to the previous list of papers. 
5. **Snowballing - Phase 1 - Selected:** List of papers selected from the previous list by applying the selection criteria.
6. **Snowballing - Phase 2 - All:** List of papers retrieved when performing the second iteration of snowballing to the previous list of papers.
7. **Snowballing - Phase 2 - Selected:** List of papers selected from the previous list by applying the selection criteria.
8. **Snowballing - Phase 3 - All:** List of papers retrieved when performing the third iteration of snowballing to the previous list of papers.
9. **Snowballing - Phase 3 - Selected:** List of papers selected from the previous list by applying the selection criteria.
10. **Final List of papers (Regular process + Snowballing)**: Final list of papers containing the papers selected during the regular process plus the ones gathered from snowballing. 
11. **Research Questions**: Research questions answered by the collected papers.
